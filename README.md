yii-kendoui
===========

This is an effort to use [KendoUI](http://www.kendoui.com)  web widgets as native Yii widgets, 
using a configuration method as close as possible to the native JavaScript used by the framework.

The repository contains a demo Yii application used to reproduce all (or at least most of)
the examples currently available in KendoUI's website

The code so far is based on the GPL version of KendoUI (they also have a license for
commrcial use. Check their website for details) and Yii 1.1.10.

By the way, thanks to the Telerik guys for being simply asesome again :D

Suggestions and contributions will be welcome.
