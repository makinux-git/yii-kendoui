yii-kendoui
===========

This is an effort to use KendoUI widgets as native Yii widgets, using a configuration
method as close as possible to the JavaScript used by KendoUI. Suggestions and contributions
will be welcome.

The code so far is based on the GPL version of KendoUI (they also have a license for
commrcial use. Check their website for details) and Yii 1.1.10.

By the way, thanks to the Telerik guys for being simply asesome again :D
